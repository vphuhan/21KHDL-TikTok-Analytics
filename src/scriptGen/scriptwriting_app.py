# Note: For this to work with Streamlit's multipage app feature:
# 1. Create a 'pages' folder in the same directory as this file
# 2. Add your page files inside that folder with names like "1_page1.py", "2_page2.py"
# 3. Each page file should be a standalone Streamlit script

# Example of what page1.py might look like:
# ```
# import streamlit as st
# st.title("Character Development")
# st.write("This is the character development page!")
# ```

# Streamlit will automatically add these pages to the sidebar navigation
