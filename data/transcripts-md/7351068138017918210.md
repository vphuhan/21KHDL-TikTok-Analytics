Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we see will defy explanation
Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination
