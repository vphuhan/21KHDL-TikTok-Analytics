I remember the day you even wrote down the day that I fell for you.
Mhm.
And now it's crossed out in print, but I still can't forget if I wanted to.
And he's driving me insane. Think I'm hearing your name everywhere I go.
But it's all in my head.
It's just all in my head.
But you won't say it, break. Or you walk in three days or since you were book ends.
Say you made some mistakes. Drink my troubles away, from a glass of champagne and you know.
I'm the first to say that I'm not often.
And you're the first to say I'm on the best thing.
But now I know a perfect way to let you go.
