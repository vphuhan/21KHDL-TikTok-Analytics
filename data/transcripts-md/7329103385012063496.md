Story story night.
Paint your pallet blue and gray.
Look out on a summer's day.
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
Shadows on the hills.
Sketch the trees and the daffodils.
Catch the breeze and the winter chills.
In colors on the snowy linen land.
Now I understand.
What you try to say to me.
And how you suffered for your sanity.
And how you try to set them free.
They would not listen they did not know how.
Perhaps they'll listen now.
