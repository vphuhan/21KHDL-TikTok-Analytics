I'm fighting for your love
I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away, but I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you tonight
I don't feel light in your love anymore
There ain't no reason to pour and force
I don't like feelings of feeling like running from something and feeling so uncontrolled
I know that the fun lives are gone
I'm spending too much time alone
I hoping you figure the phone
And ring me when you want to stay at home

My shoulders strike, my baby's old and I'm worn
And I play them all, my favorite songs
That lady is my favorite one
I can't live
