Tell me that you'll keep me safe
So both our worlds can fade away
I think i'll stray don't feel this
Hiding's hard to fake
So hold me or cry
Cause i need to empty
Don't hide
So hold me or cry
Cause i need to empty
Don't cry
Tell me that you'll keep me safe
So both our worlds can fade away
I think i'll stray don't feel this
Hiding's hard to fake
So hold me or cry
Cause i need to empty
Don't cry
All the city fall they melt right through all my eyes
Don't make me cry cause i got issues in my life
I can't explain
How long i spent just choking
It's just it feels from my heart on my sleeve and it's hard to live
Tell me that you'll keep me safe
So both our worlds can fade away
I think i'll stray don't feel this
Hiding's hard to fake
So hold me or cry
Cause i need to empty
Don't hide
So hold me or cry
Cause i need to empty
Don't cry
