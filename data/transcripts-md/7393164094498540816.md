Just wanna shout and sing I love you no matter what they say
I ask you to be the one and only shining bright always you are my star
For that you know no matter what
I can always waiting for you

At the end of exhausting day
Only you the one that can make me smile
And in the middle of my tough life
Only you that can make me laugh

At the start of another day
All I can just think of your pretty face
