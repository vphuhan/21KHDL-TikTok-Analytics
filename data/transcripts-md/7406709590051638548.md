Tangled and I’m stuck by you
Found the glue
Don’t forget to kiss me
Or else you’ll have to miss me
I guess I’m stuck forever by the glue
Won’t you feel


Finding the right words
To use for this song
I have you in my soul
It won’t take so long
Nervous thought if I’d find you
But you’re here and so I love you
Am I wrong
When I say I’ve been stuck by the glue
I see you

I’ve been stuck by glue
