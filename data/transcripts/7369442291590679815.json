Okay, I'm ready to process the Vietnamese speech. However, I need the audio file to generate the transcript and analyze the speech. Please provide the audio file so I can complete the task.

Once you provide the file, I will return a JSON object like this:

```json
{
    "transcript": "The transcript of the speech",
    "takeaways": ["Takeaway 1", "Takeaway 2", "Takeaway 3"],
    "has_call_to_action": true/false,
    "has_curiosity_gap": true/false
}
