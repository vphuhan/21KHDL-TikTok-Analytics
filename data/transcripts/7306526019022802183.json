Since the provided audio only contains sounds of chewing and no actual speech, the JSON fields are filled as follows:

*   **transcript**: Empty ("...") since there is no speech to transcribe.
*   **takeaways**: Empty list because there's no speech content to derive takeaways from.
*   **has\_call\_to\_action**: `false` because no speech means no call to action.
*   **has\_curiosity\_gap**: `false` because without speech, no curiosity can be piqued.
