Okay, I'm ready to process the audio file. Since there is no audio, I will return "None" for the transcript and create placeholders for the other fields.

```json
{
    "transcript": null,
    "takeaways": ["Takeaway 1", "Takeaway 2", "Takeaway 3"],
    "has_call_to_action": false,
    "has_curiosity_gap": false
}
