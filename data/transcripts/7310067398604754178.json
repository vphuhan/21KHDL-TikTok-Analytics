I am sorry, but I cannot extract the transcript of the speech because the provided file contains only audio with animal sounds and no speech. Thus, I cannot generate any meaningful output related to speech analysis. Therefore, the returned JSON will only reflect this limitation.

```json
{
    "transcript": null,
    "takeaways": [],
    "has_call_to_action": false,
    "has_curiosity_gap": false
}
